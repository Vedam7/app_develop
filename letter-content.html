        <p>
          Thank you God for making such a beautiful soul â€” someone who cares, motivates, and lifts others just by being themselves.
        </p>

        <p>
          From childhood, through 15 years of journey â€” even when we lost touch, you were never far from His plan.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now, when I needed it most, God reconnected you to my life â€” to bring back my strength, my consistency, and my smile.
        </p>

        <p class="highlight">
          You are not just important â€” you are a blessing Iâ€™ll always be grateful for.

        <p>â€” Thankful for God's timing and you ðŸŒŸ</p>
